The thing that comes to mind when thinking of <a href="https://getuikit.com/" target="_new">UIkit</a> is minimalism. Minimalism not in features (in fact, it offers perhaps the most features of all frameworks), but in design. If super-clean, elegant, non-whitespace-shy designs are your thing, UIkit has you covered.  Here is a basic progress bar.


```html
<progress class="uk-progress" value="" max=""></progress>
```



Or the image marker component (a JS-driven interactive marker for images):

Or even the humble HTML form:

<img src="../img/uikit-form.webp">

The elegance and minimalist style appeals to many web designers and developers out there. Just head over to the UIkit website and check out all of the incredible components it has on offer.

Unfortunately, Uikit is a self-contained system, and you wonâ€™t be able to modify or extend it without putting in considerable effort.
