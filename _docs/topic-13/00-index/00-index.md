  <h2 style="text-align: center;">CSS Frameworks</h2>
</div>

So far this semester, we have been creating our own CSS stylesheets and importing them using the `<link>` element so they govern our HTML pages. During this topic, we are going to discuss CSS frameworks. While there is a lot more that CSS frameworks can do, in their simplest form, they are a collection of CSS stylesheets that are complete and ready for you to use!

Frameworks are a great place to start when designing user interface features, like navigation bars. Rather than writing all of your CSS styling from scratch, you can start with something ready-made and then tweak and adjust as you like (depending on the framework you are using). If you use a framework, all you have to do is write your HTML using the correct structure and add the classes and ids that are used within the CSS framework to your HTML elements to make it all work together.

By the end of this Topic, we hope you:
<ul class="pros-and-cons">
  <li class="icon-pro">Have a better understanding of different CSS Frameworks.</li>
  <li class="icon-pro">Understand the pros and cons of each of the frameworks.</li>
  <li class="icon-pro">Determine if you want to incorporate them into your website.</li>
</ul>
