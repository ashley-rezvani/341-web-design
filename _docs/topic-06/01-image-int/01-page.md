  <p>Images, unlike hyperlinks, use the source attribute to retrieve additional data for the page, as opposed to sending the user to another page.</p>

  <p>As we have discussed, images are used a lot in web design and development. They help shape your website's overall look and feel, and communicate important information to your user.</p>

  <p>Like most things about the web, images have humble beginnings. To the right is first picture ever uploaded on the web, posted by Tim Burners Lee on behalf of a comedy band called <cite>Les Horrible Cernettes</cite>, July 18, 1992.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to note that the first image on the web was, in fact, Photoshopped. #NoFilter is a new concept, not a web Renaissance.</p>
