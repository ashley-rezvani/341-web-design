<div class="divider-heading"></div>

If we want an element below a floated element to not appear on the right or left, we can use the 'clear' property (`clear:`). This property tells your browser where you would like to "push" this element in relation to the floated element -- below to the right, below to the left, etc.

This can be used to create vertical menus, or control the flow of content with a containing element.
