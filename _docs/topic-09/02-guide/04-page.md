  <p>It is perfectly acceptable to place CSS within the HTML document if the CSS is minimal. However, if you want to apply certain style rules to every one of your website's pages, it is more efficient to use external "stylesheets." If you place these CSS rules in an external stylesheet that applies to all of your HTML pages, then if you would like to make a change, you only have to make this change in one place, rather than individually changing each of your HTML pages.</p>

  <p>The next section is dedicated to this method.</p>
