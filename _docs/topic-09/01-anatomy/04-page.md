<div class="divider-heading"></div>

Elements have many properties that can be affected. This course covers several of them, but not all. Luckily, many of the properties are intuitively labeled.

In the example below, our selector is the `<body>` element. The declaration is made up of the property `background-color` and we changed its value to `orange`.


<div class="codepen-embed">
  <p data-height="400" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="VwjvreL" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="retrog4m3r" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Topic-07: Anatomy of Style" class="codepen"></p>
</div>

## Altogether
<span class="label label-info">NOTE:</span> You can toggle between HTML and CSS frames in the CodePen embeds by simply clicking on their tabs:

<img src="./../img/codepen-toggle-tabs.gif" alt="Toggling tabs on CodePen embeds" title="Toggle Tabs" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px; text-align: center;" />
