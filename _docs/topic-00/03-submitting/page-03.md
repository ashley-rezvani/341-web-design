The absolute best way to ask for help in this course is to utilize the <a href="https://moodle.umt.edu/mod/hsuforum/view.php?id=2239650">Moodle forum</a>. This is ideal because:

1. Everyone has access to your question, and can help respond.
2. It is easier for your instructor to reply to these forum posts than to e-mails.
