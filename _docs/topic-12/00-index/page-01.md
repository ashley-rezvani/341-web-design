  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Responsive Web Design</h2>
</div>


We've spent this semester learning HTML and CSS. Now that you've had some practice with both, you will apply what you've learned about both web design and web development to your final project, which will be a website filled with pages that look and fuction with a cohesive theme. We will start off this topic reviewing some core CSS concepts you will need to keep in mind.

Next, we are going to learn about responsive web design, or RWD, and taking a mobile-first approach to web design. It's important to design and build your website not only thinking about its desktop appearance but also how it will display to users who are on mobile. 


By the end of this Topic, we hope you:
