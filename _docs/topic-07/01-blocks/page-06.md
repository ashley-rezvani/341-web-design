<div class="divider-heading"></div>

When thinking about page structure and layout, a good plan is to start with **divs** and begin identifying and grouping elements within:

1. “How many _divisions_ (or sections) of my page do I want?” Create these `<div></div>` elements accordingly.
2. Name important divs using the `id=""` attribute.
3. Within the divs, add [structural html](../../topic-04/structural-markup/) content, like [headings](../../topic-03/using-headings/), [paragraphs](../../topic-03/paragraphs), etc.
4. Add `class=""` attributes to divs that need styling.
5. Use the `<span></span>` element around structural elements that need inline styling, like specific words of a paragraph.
6. Within the divs, add illustrative elements like [images](../img-element-review), [audio](../audio-element-review), or [video](../video-element-review).
7. Repeat.


<div class="divider-pg"></div>
</div>
